# Module 3 - Advanced Programming 

This application is used to fulfill the **practical requirements of Module 3** in the Advanced Programming course.  
The program demonstrates basic Java programming concepts such as displaying output, using loops, and understanding console behavior through the use of `printf` and `println`.  
This simple exercise helps strengthen understanding of Java syntax, structure, and debugging processes using an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA.

## Lessons Learned

While working on this project, several key programming concepts and problem-solving skills were learned:

Understanding Java Structure:
Learned how a basic Java program is structured with the main method as the entry point.

Using Output Commands:
Explored differences between System.out.print, System.out.println, and System.out.printf in formatting text output.

Control Flow with Loops:
Practiced using for loops to perform repetitive tasks effectively.

Debugging with IDE Tools:
Learned how to use breakpoints and debugging tools in IntelliJ IDEA to track program execution.

Logical Thinking and Error Correction:
Encountered syntax and logic errors, which encouraged understanding of compiler messages and structured debugging.

## OUTPUT CODE
When this program is executed, the output shown on the console is:
```markdown
Hello and welcome!kakakApai = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
```

Explanation:

The first three texts are printed using printf without line breaks.

The for loop prints the value of i on a new line each time due to println.
